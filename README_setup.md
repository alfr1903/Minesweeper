If you haven't already, this is the time to install the prerequisite for today's workshop! 

There is a couple things required to do today's workshop: 
- Java (version 17) 
- A Java IDE - we'll show how you install Intellij, since that comes with Gradle
- If you choose a different IDE than IntelliJ - install Gradle
- JUnit 5 - the testing library we will use


Optional: 
- Git - version control system, to clone the repo we have prepared for you
